Description: This package contains data of glioblastoma electronic health records (EHRs) on CRAN. It contains three datasets: Lammer (), Shieh (), and Berendsen. Below is a detailed instruction on each of the datasets: 1. The Lammer dataset contains data from 60 patients who suffered from glioblas- toma multiforme; each patient has 7 features, including overall survival in months, that we used as target variable for time to event prediction. Patients and histological specimen from them were collected both from Klinikum rechts der Isar (TUM) and at the Klinikum Bogenhausen (STKM) in Munich, Germany. The including criteria were patients with GM that received treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and temozolomide. 2. The Shieh dataset has data from 84 patients who suffered from glioblastoma multiforme, recollected from medical records at two Taiwan Hospitals. The inclusion criteria were older than 20 years old, good performances status, and undergoing radiation therapy. This dataset contains a total of 9 covariates, including overall survival. 3. The Berendsen dataset comes from 347 patients diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastoma between 2005 and 2013 at the University Medical Center of Utrecht,in the Netherlands. The diagnosis was confirmed with histological examination. The survival data was retrieved from hospital records.
